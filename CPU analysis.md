# CPU Analysis


### Status of intel CPUs

* CPU from intel core i3, i5, i7 sereis have almost 35% cpu models `Discontinued`
* Whereas intel core i9 sereis have less then 2% of cpu models `Discontinued`
* Also only intel core i5 sereis has few cpu model ( > 0.4%) to be `Announced`

----
### State of  Smart cache

* More than 80% of intel CPU from each series (i3, i5, i7) have Intel smart cache.
* Intel core i9 series has every cpu model with intel smart cache technology.

----
### CPU launch (on the basis of year)

* intel core i3, i5, i7 series had least amount of cpu model release in the year 2016.
* whereas rest of the year they had almost decent amount of cpu model release with  more than 20 release in year 2013-15 while 2017-22 ahd little bit of fluctuations
* there is a sudden fall in year 2019-21 due to covid pandemic.
* i3 had no release in year 2023
* i9 started its journey from year 2018 and has no diclination in its realse for every year till now

----
### generation v/s core count

* the variation in core count in cpu model accros generation has increased.
* earlier generation had upto 2-4 cores but current gen have min of 6-8 cores while maximum of upto 24 cores.
* also minimum cores across generation has also increased

----
### generation v/s TDP

* minimum TDP across generation is almost constant with a small peak in 9th generaton.
* however maximum TDP across generation is increasing by small amout across the generatio with a little dip on 5th gen.
